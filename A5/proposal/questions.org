* Questions 
  - How long should the statement of work be?
  - What exactly goes in the Technical Outline?
    - Suppose I have an idea for my project. From that point onwards, would I select objectives I want to achieve. Then, for each objective, describe how I'm going to complete it and also cite papers/articles/books that will help you complete the objective?
  - Can I simply list the objectives I want to complete? Or do I need to describe how my idea will enable me to complete the objective?
    - ie: I want static and dynamic 3d collisions. vs I need to implement 3d static and dynamic collisions to account for feature x, y, z.
