# Compilation

This code does not make any additional compilation-related assumptions. It was tested only on my personal computer (since it's not worth any marks). The command to compile the program:

```BASH
# command to compile
> make
```

# Manual

No deviations were made from the specification. The code also does not make any assumptions.
